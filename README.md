# Meta-analysis
Develop meta-random-forest models to quantify the enviromental-agronomic performances (SOC, N2O emissions, N leaching, crop yield) of two climate-smart practices promoted in the US. Use these model predictions to drive a customized cost-benefit analysis framework that will guide the performance-based allocation of public incentives.
